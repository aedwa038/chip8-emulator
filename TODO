SHORT TERM
- Add remaining opcodes
- Make random function random

LONG TERM
- Fix key bindings. All over the place at the moment.
  May provide option to specify keyboard mapping file.

- Optimise code. Specifically, switch statements in order.
  Biggest switch to smallest I think.

- Stop display flickering so much.
